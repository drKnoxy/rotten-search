# Rotten Search

I got a developer test from a company I was applying to.
I thought it was a pretty fun, and offered up the opportunity
to show my expertise in a public forum. To check out this project
fire up a local server in the root of the project ie. `php -Slocalhost:3000`.

*JavaScript Know-How*
* Querrying a third party api via AJAX and jsonp
* Running json through a templating engine
* I opted to use the _Revealing Module Pattern_
* Regex
* jQuery usage

*CSS Know-How*
* Font embedding
* Normalizing styles
* `box-sizing` usage, and implementation best practices
* I haven't used the [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) style for CSS before, so I thought I'd give it a shot here

*General*
* Code organization
* Using a local server
